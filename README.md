# Mocs-Arcade
UTC Computer Science Senior Project 2015

This is intended to handle downloading/updating student made games and then launch them.

This branch is the Development Release branch. This is intended to be used for testing new updates and code very early in the testing process

In order to install this branch to your computer please ensure you have a Java Runtime Environment installed.

To launch the arcade please open Mocs-Arcade.jar
If you plan on needing the Log please run it in a command line terminal with:

<code>java -jar Mocs-Arcade.jar</code>
